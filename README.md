### Hi! 

Thank you for checking out CharlieDAO's GitHub. 

### Mission Statement

Web 2.0 is closed source, adversarial, centralized, and exploitive.
Web 3.0 is open source, collaborative, decentralized, and consensual.

CharlieDAO is a decentralized collective of analysts, product folk, crypto natives, and software developers making Web 3.0 things.

We work across 3 "prongs": 

#### Evangelize Web 3

We write articles, record podcast, mentor new joiners, curate resources, speak at conferences, and generally do whatever we can to help creators, consumers, and communities 
understand the opportunity of Web 3.0.

#### Build DeFi Primitives

We identify market gaps in the financial side of Web 3, ("crypto", "defi", etc.) and build fundamental technologies that others can freely build on. Anything monetized is spun out into its own entity, with the vision of 0 governance and 0 administration. Our products should be immutable, day 1 complete, directly funded by users, and as much as reasonable have its revenue mechanisms given to a users too.  

#### Improve Market Information with Analytics 

A plurality of the collective is data scientists, so we work to improve the open data movement in Web 3. We use FlipSide Crypto, Dune, Etherscan, and other data sources to help communities understand themselves and their position in the market. 

### CharlieDAO governance & legal note

CharlieDAO is a registered sole proprietorship, with trademark, in the state of MD, USA as the creation of the administrator: charliemarketplace. As such, we do not maintain a treasury nor collect revenue as an organization. We do not have a governance token, nor NFTs. We will likely never launch such things. Members of the collective self-organize into product teams, develop minimally viable products, and spin out into their own entities with whatever structure they agree upon prior to monetization. 

You may see contributors and product teams independently accept donations, raise funding, or charge for their products. They do so as distinct entities with separate wallets, websites, and legal registrations. Please do not send money to, purchase products claiming to be from, or otherwise contribute value to CharlieDAO without having coordinated with the administrator to exchange relevant documentation and an understanding of how that value is earmarked (typically limited to operational expenses and shared computing resources). All funds sent to CharlieDAO without such coordination will be considered non-tax deductible donations & income of the sole proprietor (NOT the organization) and will not be accounted for as a purchase of governance, revenue, or similar.

 Unlike LLCs with a discord who claim to be DAOs, we take the term DAO literally. We are a collective of individuals, self-organizing, autonomously, into products that spin-out.
 
 Thank you!
